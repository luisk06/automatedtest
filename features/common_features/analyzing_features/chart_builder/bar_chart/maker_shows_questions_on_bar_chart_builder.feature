Feature: Building a Bar chart visualization with differents questions types

	As an user
	I want to visualize differents questions on a customized bar chart
	In order to clarify relations between them

	Scenario Outline: The user build a bar chart using a <categoryQuestionType> and <valueQuestionType> questions on <typeOfQrvey>, using <aggregateType> as aggregate
		Given the user has webform app with a "<typeOfQrvey>" with "bar" chart builder compatible questions with 40 responses
			And the user is logged in
			And the user opens the just created app
			And the user opens the "webform" board
		When the user clicks on the "qrvey_results" "button" of the just created qrvey
			And user selects "custom" from dropdown on "<typeOfQrvey>"
			And the user clicks on add chart
			And the user selects "bar_chart" chart
			And the user enter "Chart bar test" as bar chart name
			And the user selects "<categoryQuestionType>" from "category" dropdown
			And the user selects "<valueQuestionType>" from "value" dropdown
			And the user selects "<aggregateType>" from "aggregate" dropdown
			And the user clicks on save chart button
		Then a custom panel should be displayed with "Chart bar test" as title
			And the bars should not be "0"

		Examples:
			| typeOfQrvey     	| categoryQuestionType 	| valueQuestionType 	| aggregateType |
			| forms           	| Single Selection     	| Numeric         		| Count       	|
