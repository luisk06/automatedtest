Feature: The user displays a date question results in progressive

	As an user
	I want see the results of a date question
	In order to analyse the open responses of the users

	Scenario Outline: The user filters the results of a date question with <numAnswers> answers
		Given that there is a webform app with a "progressive" with a "date" question that has <numAnswers> answers with the following dates:
				| dates    |
				| 01/01/01 |
				| 02/02/02 |
				| 03/03/03 |
				| 04/04/04 |
				| 05/05/05 |
			And the user is logged in
			And the user opens the just created app
			And the user opens the "webform" board
		When the user clicks on the "qrvey_results" "button" of the just created qrvey
			And the user clicks on the filter button
			And the user clicks on the "<filteredAnswer>" date filter
			And the user clicks on the "apply_filter" "button"
			And the user clicks on the "filters" "button"
		Then the "<filteredAnswer>" date answer filter should appear in the histogram filters
			And the number answers should be more than 0

		Examples:
			| numAnswers | filteredAnswer | afterFilterAnswers |
			| 8          | 01/01/01       | 2                  |
